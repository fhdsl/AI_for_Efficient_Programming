# Understanding Unfamiliar Code

As a programmer, you will frequently encounter situations where you need to read and understand code written by other developers. This could be because you are collaborating on a project, you have taken over maintenance of an existing codebase, or you are learning new syntax or skills that require reading example codes. Comprehending code written by someone else is a distinct skill from being able to write your own code, and it takes practice to become proficient at it.

When reading unfamiliar code, you need to be able to decipher the logic, understand the programming language syntax and semantics, and make sense of the naming conventions and architecture of the code. Furthermore, you may need to understand the context in which the code was written and any assumptions made by the original developer. All of these factors can make the process of understanding code written by someone else challenging.

That said, learning how to read and understand code written by someone else is a valuable skill that can help you be a more effective programmer. By being able to read and comprehend unfamiliar code, you can contribute to projects more quickly, diagnose and fix bugs more effectively, and learn new programming techniques and best practices. As with any skill, the more you practice reading and understanding code written by others, the more comfortable and proficient you will become at it.

## Using AI to understand code

AI offers various ways to help programmers understand code written by others. Firstly, AI tools can analyze the codebase and provide insights into its structure, complexity, and potential defects. This analysis can identify parts of the code that may be challenging to understand, maintain or improve. Based on the analysis, the AI tools may also make recommendations on how to enhance the codebase for better functionality and readability.

Secondly, AI tools can assist in summarizing large codebases, which can be challenging to comprehend in detail. Such codebases may have multiple files, functions, and classes, which could take a considerable amount of time to read and understand thoroughly. With the help of AI, programmers can get a high-level overview of the codebase without going through it line by line. This approach can save considerable time and effort, especially when dealing with complex codebases.

Finally, AI can help programmers to understand the comments and documentation written by other developers. These insights can help programmers to understand the code's purpose and the assumptions and limitations of the codebase. AI can achieve this by analyzing the natural language used in the comments and documentation, and providing a more accurate interpretation and understanding of what the original developer intended.

**Ethical Considerations**

AI language models like ChatGPT, Bard, and others have the ability to summarize code and offer valuable insights into its workings. However, it's important to consider the ethics of using AI to summarize code that someone else has written. Several factors come into play, such as the intended purpose of the summary, the ownership of the code, and the potential impact of the summary. Specifically, it's important to take into account who owns the code, the reason for summarizing the code, and whether the code contains any sensitive or personal information.

If the reason for summarizing the code is for educational or research purposes, and the code is either publicly available or the owner has granted explicit permission for its use, then it's likely ethical to use AI to summarize the code. However, if the summary is intended for commercial purposes or could potentially infringe upon the owner's intellectual property rights, it may be unethical to use AI to summarize the code without obtaining the owner's consent. Additionally, if the code contains confidential or personal information, using AI to summarize it could raise privacy concerns. In such cases, obtaining explicit consent from the owner and implementing appropriate measures to ensure that the summary does not reveal any confidential information may be necessary.

Overall, the ethics of using AI to summarize code someone else wrote depend on the specific circumstances and should be carefully considered before proceeding. It is important to respect the intellectual property rights and privacy of the owner and ensure that the summary is used in a responsible and ethical manner.

## Benefits of using AI

While anyone can learn to understand code written by someone else, using AI language models to achieve this has three significant advantages. These benefits include:

**Increased efficiency**: AI language models can quickly analyze large amounts of code and provide a summary of its functionality, which can save developers a significant amount of time compared to manually analyzing the code line-by-line. By automating this process, developers can devote more time to other important tasks, such as debugging, testing, and improving the code.

**Error reduction**: AI language models can help to identify errors and inconsistencies in the code, which can be particularly helpful when working with complex or large-scale projects. By catching these issues early, developers can avoid potential bugs and glitches down the line, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective codebase.

**Understanding design decisions**: AI language models can offer developers valuable insights into the design decisions and implementation details of code. This can be especially helpful when working with older or legacy code, or when collaborating with other developers on a project. By gaining a deeper understanding of the codebase, developers can make better-informed decisions when it comes to adding new features, improving existing functionality, or fixing bugs. For instance, understanding how a particular piece of code works and why it was implemented a certain way can help developers identify potential issues and find more effective solutions. This can ultimately lead to a more efficient and effective codebase, resulting in a better end-user experience.

Overall, using AI language models to understand code can help developers work more efficiently, make fewer mistakes, and gain valuable insights into the code they're working on. As AI technology continues to improve, it's likely that these tools will become even more powerful and widely used in the software development industry, helping developers to build better software more quickly and easily.
