# Understanding Unfamiliar Code

As a programmer, you will frequently encounter situations where you need to read and understand code written by other developers. This could be because you are collaborating on a project, you have taken over maintenance of an existing codebase, or you are learning new syntax or skills that require reading example codes. Comprehending code written by someone else is a distinct skill from being able to write your own code, and it takes practice to become proficient at it.

When reading unfamiliar code, you need to be able to decipher the logic, understand the programming language syntax and semantics, and make sense of the naming conventions and architecture of the code. Furthermore, you may need to understand the context in which the code was written and any assumptions made by the original developer. All of these factors can make the process of understanding code written by someone else challenging.

That said, learning how to read and understand code written by someone else is a valuable skill that can help you be a more effective programmer. By being able to read and comprehend unfamiliar code, you can contribute to projects more quickly, diagnose and fix bugs more effectively, and learn new programming techniques and best practices. As with any skill, the more you practice reading and understanding code written by others, the more comfortable and proficient you will become at it.

## Using AI to understand code

_"It's like having a paired programmer explain things to you."_ 

AI offers various ways to help programmers understand code written by others. Firstly, AI tools can analyze the codebase and provide insights into its structure, complexity, and potential defects. This analysis can identify parts of the code that may be challenging to understand, maintain or improve. Based on the analysis, the AI tools may also make recommendations on how to enhance the codebase for better functionality and readability.

Secondly, AI tools can assist in summarizing large codebases, which can be challenging to comprehend in detail. Such codebases may have multiple files, functions, and classes, which could take a considerable amount of time to read and understand thoroughly. With the help of AI, programmers can get a high-level overview of the codebase without going through it line by line. This approach can save considerable time and effort, especially when dealing with complex codebases.

Finally, AI can help programmers to understand the comments and documentation written by other developers. These insights can help programmers to understand the code's purpose and the assumptions and limitations of the codebase. AI can achieve this by analyzing the natural language used in the comments and documentation, and providing a more accurate interpretation and understanding of what the original developer intended.

**Ethical Considerations**

AI language models like ChatGPT, Bard, and others have the ability to summarize code and offer valuable insights into its workings. However, it's important to consider the ethics of using AI to summarize code that someone else has written. Several factors come into play, such as the intended purpose of the summary, the ownership of the code, and the potential impact of the summary. Specifically, it's important to take into account who owns the code, the reason for summarizing the code, and whether the code contains any sensitive or personal information.

If the reason for summarizing the code is for educational or research purposes, and the code is either publicly available or the owner has granted explicit permission for its use, then it's likely ethical to use AI to summarize the code. However, if the summary is intended for commercial purposes or could potentially infringe upon the owner's intellectual property rights, it may be unethical to use AI to summarize the code without obtaining the owner's consent. Additionally, if the code contains confidential or personal information, using AI to summarize it could raise privacy concerns. In such cases, obtaining explicit consent from the owner and implementing appropriate measures to ensure that the summary does not reveal any confidential information may be necessary.

Overall, the ethics of using AI to summarize code someone else wrote depend on the specific circumstances and should be carefully considered before proceeding. It is important to respect the intellectual property rights and privacy of the owner and ensure that the summary is used in a responsible and ethical manner.

## Benefits of using AI

While anyone can learn to understand code written by someone else, using AI language models to achieve this has three significant advantages. These benefits include:

**Increased efficiency**: AI language models can quickly analyze large amounts of code and provide a summary of its functionality, which can save developers a significant amount of time compared to manually analyzing the code line-by-line. By automating this process, developers can devote more time to other important tasks, such as debugging, testing, and improving the code.

**Error reduction**: AI language models can help to identify errors and inconsistencies in the code, which can be particularly helpful when working with complex or large-scale projects. By catching these issues early, developers can avoid potential bugs and glitches down the line, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective codebase.

**Understanding design decisions**: AI language models can offer developers valuable insights into the design decisions and implementation details of code. This can be especially helpful when working with older or legacy code, or when collaborating with other developers on a project. By gaining a deeper understanding of the codebase, developers can make better-informed decisions when it comes to adding new features, improving existing functionality, or fixing bugs. For instance, understanding how a particular piece of code works and why it was implemented a certain way can help developers identify potential issues and find more effective solutions. This can ultimately lead to a more efficient and effective codebase, resulting in a better end-user experience.

Overall, using AI language models to understand code can help developers work more efficiently, make fewer mistakes, and gain valuable insights into the code they're working on. As AI technology continues to improve, it's likely that these tools will become even more powerful and widely used in the software development industry, helping developers to build better software more quickly and easily.

## Exercise One: Using AI to summarize code

Let's start with a relatively simple code using the R programming language.

```
library(tidyverse)

diamonds <- ggplot2::diamonds

diamonds_selected <- diamonds %>%
  select(carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price)

diamonds_filtered <- diamonds_selected %>%
  filter(price > 5000)

diamonds_binned <- diamonds_filtered %>%
  mutate(carat_bins = cut_width(carat, width = 0.2))

diamonds_summary <- diamonds_binned %>%
  group_by(carat_bins, cut, color, clarity) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price), sd_price = sd(price))

ggplot(diamonds_summary, aes(x = mean_price, y = sd_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cut ~ color + clarity) +
  labs(x = "Mean Price", y = "Standard Deviation of Price")
```

If you are familiar with R, you might be able to understand what this code does with little effort. However, if you don't know R, you're relatively new to R, or you're just having a bad day, understanding what this bit of code can take a great deal more energy and time. AI language bots can ease that burden.

We asked Bard to explain the purpose of this code, and got this response:

"The code you provided is an example of how to use the R programming language to analyze data. The code first loads the tidyverse package, which provides a set of tools for data wrangling and analysis. It then loads the diamonds dataset, which contains information about 53,940 diamonds. The code then selects the carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and price variables from the dataset. It then filters the dataset to only include diamonds with a price greater than 5000. It then bins the carat values into 0.2 carat bins. It then summarizes the data by grouping it by carat bin, cut, color, and clarity, and then calculating the mean and standard deviation of the price for each group. Finally, it creates a plot of the mean price versus the standard deviation of the price, with the cut, color, and clarity as factors. The plot shows that the mean price increases with carat size, and that the standard deviation of the price is higher for diamonds with lower clarity."

Great! Now we know a couple of things:

1. This bit of code uses the tidyverse package.

1. We're also using the diamonds dataset.

1. After the dataset is loaded, the dataset is filtered by price.

1. The diamonds in the filtered dataset are grouped by carat, cut, color, and clarity, after which the mean and standard deviation of the price for each group is calculated.

1. Finally, the code plots the mean prices against the grouping variables.


Okay, but maybe don't know what the tidyverse is. We can ask Bard to explain:

"The tidyverse is a collection of packages for the R programming language that are designed to make data analysis easier and more efficient. The tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, which is based on the idea of tidy data. Tidy data is data that is stored in a tabular format, with each row representing a data point and each column representing a variable."
