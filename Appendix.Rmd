## Additional Programming Languages {-}

You might also encounter these programming languages on your software journey.

**Julia**

Julia is designed for numerical and scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. It has a syntax that is easy to learn and read, making it an ideal choice for data scientists, engineers, and researchers. Julia code can also be compiled to native machine code using the Julia compiler. Because Julia is a relatively new language, it has fewer add-on libraries and resources available compared to more established languages.

**MATLAB**

MATLAB is a high-level programming language and development environment commonly used for numerical computation, data analysis, and visualization. It is widely used in engineering, physics, and finance, among other fields. It is generally considered to have a user-friendly syntax and is relatively easy to learn compared to other languages. MATLAB has a development environment called MATLAB Compiler that allows you to package MATLAB code into standalone executables or shared libraries for use on a wide variety of operating systems. 

**Fortran**

Fortran has been around for decades and has a long history in scientific and engineering communities. It has a more challenging syntax and is considered harder to learn than some of the other languages on this list. It is primarily used for scientific and engineering applications that require numerical computations and simulations such as computational physics, weather forecasting, and computational chemistry.

**Rust**

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on speed, reliability, and memory safety. It is commonly used for developing performance-critical software, such as operating systems, web browsers, and game engines. Rust's syntax is similar to C++, but is often considered to have a steeper learning curve due to its focus on memory safety and ownership concepts.
